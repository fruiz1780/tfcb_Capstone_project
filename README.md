##About the Data
This is where I talk about the data, assumptions etc

The dataset that I chose to investigate further was the [Immunohistochemical typing of adenocarcinomas](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.g8h71).
I am specifically working with the dataset that is found in the ["pcbil_clinicaldata.xlsx"](/data/pcbil_clinicaldata.xlsx) in the "PLOS Revision" tab. I have placed the data that was in the "PLOS Revision" tab into a new csv file found [here](/data/pcbil_clinicaldata_PLOS_REVISION.csv)

## Project organization

Information about things in this project

Within the data folder, I have placed the dataset that I extracted from DRYAD. The dataset had a "pcbil_clinicaldata.xlsx" excelsheet but in order to make dtaaframes in Python, I made separate CSV files for each sheet in the excel workbook.
